#' Aggregate (merge) adjacent clusters by spatial proximity
#'
#' Iteratively merges temporally adjacent `cluster` ids whose locations are within
#' `dist` of each other. This is a repair/aggregation step for an existing clustering:
#' it does not compute clusters from scratch, it merges neighbouring ones.
#'
#' @details
#' Merging is put as a graph problem. An undirected adjacency graph is constructed with one
#' vertex per `cluster`. An edge is added between two vertices corresponding to consecutive cluster
#' ids (`cluster` and `cluster + 1`) if the distance between their geometries is less
#' than `dist`. clusters are merged by taking connected components of this graph.
#' The procedure is repeated until no further merges occur.
#'
#' Representative geometry for each cluster is computed as the centroid of the convex hull of all
#' points in that cluster.
#'
#' This updates `cluster` by reference.
#'
#' @param ctdf A `ctdf` object. Must contain `cluster`, `timestamp`, and `location`.
#' @param dist Aggregation scale in km.
#'
#' @return The input `ctdf`, invisibly, with `cluster` updated in-place.
