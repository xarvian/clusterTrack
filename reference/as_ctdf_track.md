# Convert a `ctdf` track to movement step segments as LINESTRINGs

Takes a `ctdf` object and returns an `sf` object with LINESTRING
geometries representing the movement steps between consecutive
locations. Each segment connects two points, starting at the previous
location and ending at the current one - i.e., each segment ends at the
position of the current row.

## Usage

``` r
as_ctdf_track(ctdf)
```

## Arguments

- ctdf:

  A `ctdf` object (with ordered rows and a `"location"` geometry
  column).

## Value

An `sf` object with LINESTRING geometry for each step.

## Details

The number of rows is nrow(ctdf) - i, where i = 1 and corresponds to the
starting index in ctdf.

## Examples

``` r
data(mini_ruff)
ctdf = as_ctdf(mini_ruff)
s = as_ctdf_track(ctdf)
plot(s['.id'])

```
